		<h2>Municipal Waste</h2>
		<p>Municipal waste is defined as waste collected and treated by or for municipalities. It covers waste from households, including bulky waste, similar waste from commerce and trade, office buildings, institutions and small businesses, as well as yard and garden waste, street sweepings, the contents of litter containers, and market cleansing waste if managed as household waste. The definition excludes waste from municipal sewage networks and treatment, as well as waste from construction and demolition activities. This indicator is measured in thousand tonnes and in kilograms per capita.</p>

		<h3>A Survey by EPAâ€™s Advancing Sustainable Materials Management</h3>
		<p><span class="dot"></span> The total quantity of MSW generated in the U.S. grew steadily from 88 million tons (MT) in 1960 to a peakof 268 MT in 2017  Of the MSW generated in 1960, 6 percent was recycled and 94 percent waslandfilled or disposed of using other methods (including open burning).<br> <span class="dot"></span> In 2017, 25 percent ofMSW was recycled, 10 percent was composted, 13 percent was combusted with energy recovery and 52percent was landfilled or disposed of using other methods.<br> <span class="dot"></span> The last several decades have seensteady growth in recycling and composting, while the total amounts landfilled peaked in 1990 (145 MT) andhave generally declined since then (140 MT in 2017).<br><span class="dot"></span> The total amounts combusted with energy recoveryhave remained fairly steady since 1990. Disposal practices have also been influenced by the development oflarge waste-to-energy facilities, particularly during the 1980s.Overall, from 1960 to 2017, total MSW generation in the U.S. increased by 204 percent.<br><span class="dot"></span> During this time, U.S. population increased by 80 percent and the size of the U.S. economy, as measured by real GDP, grewby 455 percent. MSW generation per capita increased by 71 percent from 1960 to 1990 (from 2.7 to 4.6pounds per person per day) but has leveled off since then. MSW generation per dollar GDP has decreasedsteadily over the last five decades, with a 45 percent decrease from 1960 to 2017.</p>

		<h2>Prevention of Municipal Waste</h2>
		<p><span class="dot"></span><span class="type"> Open Dumps</span><br>pen dumps refer to uncovered areas that are used to dump solid waste of all kinds. The waste is untreated, uncovered, and not segregated. It is the breeding ground for flies, rats, and other insects that spread disease. The rainwater run-off from these dumps contaminates nearby land and water thereby spreading disease. In some countries, open dumps are being phased out.<br>
		<span class="dot"></span><span class="type"> Landfills</span><br>Landfills are generally located in urban areas where a large amount of waste is generated and has to be dumped in a common place. Unlike an open dump, it is a pit that is dug in the ground. The garbage is dumped and the pit is covered thus preventing the breeding of flies and rats. At the end of each day, a layer of soil is scattered on top of it and some mechanism, usually an earth-moving equipment is used to compress the garbage, which now forms a cell. Thus, every day, garbage is dumped and becomes a cell. After the landfill is full, the area is covered with a thick layer of mud and the site can thereafter be developed as a parking lot or a park.<br>Landfills have many problems. All types of waste is dumped in landfills and when water seeps through them it gets contaminated and in turn pollutes the surrounding area. This contamination of groundwater and soil through landfills is known as leaching.<br>
		<span class="dot"></span><span class="type"> Sanitary Landfills</span><br>An alternative to landfills which will solve the problem of leaching to some extent, is a sanitary landfill which is more hygienic and built in a methodical manner. These are lined with materials that are impermeable such as plastics and clay, and are also built over impermeable soil. Constructing sanitary landfills is very costly and they are have their own problems. Some authorities claim that often the plastic liner develops cracks as it reacts with various chemical solvents present in the waste.<br>
	<span class="dot"></span><span class="type"> Incineration Plants</span><br>This process of burning waste in large furnaces is known as incineration. In these plants the recyclable material is segregated and the rest of the material is burnt. At the end of the process all that is left behind is ash. During the process some of the ash floats out with the hot air. This is called fly ash. Both the fly ash and the ash that is left in the furnace after burning have high concentrations of dangerous toxins such as dioxins and heavy metals. Disposing of this ash is a problem. The ash that is buried at the landfills leaches the area and cause severe contamination.</p>
