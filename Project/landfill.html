		<h2>Sanitary Landfill</h2>
		<p>Sanitary landfill is a modern engineering landfill where waste is allowed to decompose into biologically and chemically inert materials in a setting isolated from the environment.Sanitary landfills can be designed to be an environmentally acceptable means of waste disposal, provided they are properly operated. <br>In addition, suitable land for landfill sites close to nearby urbanizing areas is now less available for many communities, thereby resulting in these communities having to locate more distant landfill sites. Large landfills will require more investment to improve standards than smaller sites. However, the unit cost of these improvements will decrease with increasing site size. There are financial and other benefits to sites with long operating lifetimes . Large regional sites serving two or more cities could be economically beneficial, providing waste transport costs are not too high</p>

		<h2>Basic Requirements</h2>
		<p>As a minimum, four basic conditions should be met by any site design and operation before it can be regarded as a sanitary landfill:<br>
				 <span class="dot"></span> Full or partial hydrogeological isolation: if a site cannot be located on land which naturally contains leachate security, additional lining materials should be brought to the site to reduce leakage from the base of the site (leachate) and help reduce contamination of groundwater and surrounding soil. If a liner - soil or synthetic - is provided without a system of leachate collection, all leachate will eventually reach the surrounding environment. Leachate collection and treatment must be stressed as a basic requirement.<br>
 <span class="dot"></span> Formal engineering preparations: designs should be developed from local geological and hydrogeological investigations. A waste disposal plan and a final restoration plan should also be developed.<br>
 <span class="dot"></span> Permanent control: trained staff should be based at the landfill to supervise site preparation and construction, the depositing of waste and the regular operation and maintenance.<br>
<span class="dot"></span> Planned waste emplacement and covering: waste should be spread in layers and compacted. A small working area which is covered daily helps make the waste less accessible to pests and vermin.

	<h3>Advantages</h3>
	<p> <span class="dot"></span> <span class="Some"> Landfills are an Excellent Energy Source</span><br>
When trash accumulates and begins to break down, carbon dioxide and methane are produced. These gases can be taken out, filtered out, and used for energy production. In the United States, landfills serve as the third source of methane production. The landfills in the country also produce approximately 95.6 million of these Carbon (IV)oxide per annum. <br>
<span class="dot"></span> <span class="Some">Modern Landfills are Eco-friendly</span><br>
Older landfills were just open-air dump for nearly everything but it isn’t the case anymore. Thanks to the efforts of environmental experts and conservationists who brought in strict laws, regulations, and standards for landfill sites. Technology is well utilized in the landfills’ design; good soil lining and leachate management system ensures no seepage and damage.<br>
<span class="dot"></span> <span class="Some">  Keep Cities, Towns, and Districts Clean</span><br>
Any city that doesn’t have a landfill or when people know there is no efficient waste management system in place, they would simply dump waste in the vacant spots. This is unhealthy for humans and the environment. With properly maintained landfill facilities, local trash will be dealt with locally instead of shifting them to other countries.<br>
<span class="dot"></span> <span class="Some"> Keeps Hazardous Waste Segregated</span><br>
Landfills provide a place to dump recyclable and non-recyclable waste separately. Also, they provide a place to keep more hazardous materials that need to be segregated from the public.<br>
<span class="dot"></span> <span class="Some"> Landfills are Cheap</span><br>
Garbage transport costs will be reduced, as our waste will only have to travel a short distance to landfill. This will also reduce the amount of pollution caused by transporting rubbish.<br>
<span class="dot"></span> <span class="Some"> Landfills Support Jobs and Local Business</span><br>
An effective waste management system of any country is a million-dollar activity with every stage needing workforce. More local landfills mean more job opportunities and better living for the locals.</p>

	<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
	<p>
		 <span class="dot"></span> <span class="Some">Landfills are Partially Responsible For Climate Change</span><br>
One tonne of biodegradable waste can produce about 400–500 cubic meters of landfill gas. Landfill gas contains methane and carbon dioxide as the major constituents and traces of other gases. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is 25x more potent than carbon dioxide. Thus, increases the implications of global warming and climate change.  <br>
<span class="dot"></span><span class="Some"> Methane Lights up Easily</span> br>
Methane is a highly inflammable gas. In an enclosed space with poor ventilation, it lights up quite easily and the entire landfill site can be on fire in seconds. The range of air concentrations at which methane becomes explosive is between 5 to 15% of the total air volume.<br>
<span class="dot"></span><span class="Some"> Contaminate Soil and Water</span><br>
Although it’s not very common for protective membranes of landfills to rupture, it can be devastating when they do. Hazardous chemicals, gases, and toxins seep from landfills, get mixed with soil and groundwater causing soil and water pollution.<br>
<span class="dot"></span><span class="Some"> Landfills Affect Wildlife</span><br>
Landfill sites have negative effects on plants and animals. Certain birds and animals feed on landfill sites. By doing so they ingest plastic, aluminum, drywall, and other materials.<br>
<span class="dot"></span><span class="Some"> Accidents Can Happen</span><br>
Rain, spontaneous combustion of gases or materials, or excessive waste accumulation makes landfill sites vulnerable to collapses; the damages are deep and almost irreversible. The death toll was 113 when a massive landfill outside Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa collapsed in March 2017.<br>
<span class="dot"></span><span class="Some"> Landfills Affect Human Health</span><br>
Studies have been shown that people living near or prolonged exposure to landfills have been linked to cancer, respiratory disorders, and developmental defects in children.
